## Hi there, I'm [@xxchan](https://github.com/xxchan/) 👋

This organization contains the collection of my toy projects during learning. Some of them might be helpful.

Some highlights (incomplete unordered list):
- [leptjson](https://github.com/ixxchan/leptjson): A tiny JSON parser. 
This was my first exposure to engineering. It's a very friendly project development tutorial for novices and sparked my interest in engineering. 😊
- [CIS194-Assignments](https://github.com/ixxchan/CIS194-Assignments): Assignments of UPenn CIS 194 - Spring 2013, a very good introduction cource for Haskell. 
My interest in functional programming stems from this course along with [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) and [Programming Languages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). ❤️
- [kvs](https://github.com/ixxchan/kvs): A tiny key-value store. 
Following the course [Practical Networked Applications in Rust](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/01b656db962cea7d653182354b0bb3b6f146dbe0/courses/rust/README.md). 
The awesome course introduced may practial aspects in real-world engineering, but I did not invest much time in digesting the content and implementing the project. 😓

Some others:
- [osc10e](https://github.com/ixxchan/osc10e): Operating System Concepts projects
- [CSAPP-Labs](https://github.com/ixxchan/csapp-labs): CS:APP3e labs
